This project encompasses my half of semester assignment, which I intend to present and share within this forum.
# Dice Game

This is a simple text-based Dice Game that allows a player to play against the computer. The game's objective is for the first player to score 100 points. If a player rolls one 1, they lose all their accumulated points in their turn. If they roll two 1's, they lose all their points, and their turn is over. Players can choose to turn over the dice at any time, but if they roll one or two 1's, they lose their turn.

The computer plays by the same rules as the player, except it will always turn over the dice when it has rolled 20 or more points in a single turn.

# How to Play

    The game will start by printing the welcome message and rules.
    The player will be prompted to input 'y' when ready to start playing.
    The player will roll the dice and get a score based on the sum of the dice. The score will be added to their turn score.
    If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose their accumulated points in that turn.
    The player can choose to continue rolling or turn over the dice.
    If the player chooses to turn over the dice or rolls two 1's, their turn ends, and their turn score is added to their total score.
    The game continues until one of the players scores 100 points.
    The player with the highest score wins.

# How to Run

    Clone the repository or download the source code.
    Compile and run the DiceGame.java file in the command line or an IDE of your choice.

Enjoy playing!
